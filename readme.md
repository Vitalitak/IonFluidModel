1D Fluid model of collisionless Ar plasma sheath and presheath

Electrons have Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Ions are calculated in self-consistent fluid model.

Three main blocks:
1. Stationary self-consistent distribution of potential, concentration and ion velocity form plasma to the electrode
2. Dynamic calculation of sheath and presheath applying RF bias
3. Monte-Carlo transport of ions across presheath and sheath
