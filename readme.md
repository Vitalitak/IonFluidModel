1D Fluid model of collisionless Ar plasma sheath and presheath

Electrons have Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Ions are calculated in self-consistent fluid model.

Three main blocks:
1. Stationary self-consistent distribution of potential, ion concentration and ion velocity from plasma to the electrode
\
With Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of electron concentration and electron velocity that satisfies the momentum change equation with self-consistent potential and Boltzmann concentration. Criteria for electron velocity are plasma velocity at plasma surface and equality of electron and ion fluxes at the electrode surface
2. Dynamic calculation of sheath and presheath applying RF bias
3. Monte-Carlo transport of ions across presheath and sheath
